## üñ•Ô∏è Best Use of Velo by Wix

I have to use Velo by Wix to create a website. With Wix Velo, a full-stack development platform, you can create a website without knowing any code. It is a fantastic tool for both experienced developers who want to construct a website quickly and newbies who want to learn how to code. And we make use of Wix's following features:
- Wix Data: It may be used to both save data in a database and retrieve data from one.
- Wix Code: Aids in adding some unique code for making notes using Open AI.
- Wix SEO: I'm utilizing Wix SEO to give the website SEO functionality, and we can also use it to give the store SEO functionality.
- Wix Stores: We may use it to build the store and integrate it with the website.
- Users of Wix: We may use it to provide useful functionality to the store in addition to adding useful functionality to the website.

## Challenges I ran into

- Because we had to implement the project by a certain date, finishing the project was difficult.
- I had to learn how to use Wix because I am a new user.
- The Wix Velo platform required some instruction on our part.
- Implementing the notes page was a bit difficult.
